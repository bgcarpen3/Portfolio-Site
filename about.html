					<h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
					<p>I can vividly remember seeing my first movie from Japan; I was 5 years old. The colors and the images were stuck in my head. It was as if a painting was moving. I got closer to the tv and became entranced. It was then that my love of Japan had started. When I was in Elementary School are book fair provided books from Japan for purchase. There was cultural, biographical, and even sub/pop culture. They would provide Shounen Jump translated into English with Yu GI Oh! or Pokemon cards attached inside. We then fast forward to me in University. I was so enamored thinking about myself at 5 years old again. I recalled seeing the Japanese movie and decided I wanted to learn about animation. I learned a million other things besides animaton. But I also did finally not only learn more about but also make the thing I remembered sp fondly.
						I then realized I enjoyed appreciating others works far more than creating animation myself. I also learned about Japanese culture and Japanese in general while at University. I then thought about the million things I have learned. What was it that I enjoyed creating? Not something I wanted to look at but something I wanted to create. I thought long and hard until I made a decisive choice. I wanted to create things with the Web Design and Frontend skills I had learned.
					<p>I then moved to Japan as an English teacher. Which is quite enjoyable since I like kids. But it is not what I truly want. I want to use my skills in web development. Also I am striving to make self growth by studying each day. That way I can make my goal a reality. Ah! If you are wondering? Yes I do enjoy Japan and it is better than I expected. I want to stay here for a long time. Also I also no longer have a beard like in this photo.</p>
